# Introduction

In this repo, we provide the numarical computation of beam analysis we presented in our submitted paper:
- A. Kose, H. Lee, C. H. Foh, "Multi-Agent Context Learning Bandit for Interference-Aware Beam 
  Allocation in mmWave Vehicular Communications," submitted.
  
# Numerical Validation

We share our numerical computation code online:

# Simulation Code

The simulation code is also available in this repo [[click here]](...).
The simulation code requires 
[![Pymosim v0.8.8](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pymosim-v0.8.8-brightgreen)](https://cfoh.github.io/pymosim-doc/start.html) 
platform to run. We plan to open the source of Pymosim soon.
Meanwhile, you can inspect the simulation code and understand the simulation setup.
